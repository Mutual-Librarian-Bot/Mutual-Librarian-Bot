# Mutual-Librarian-Bot
I don't have much of an idea as to what to put here, at least not professionally or formally.

The idea behind this discord bot is to aid in the reading of literature, whether by yourself or as a community, or both!

### How
How this bot aids in reading literature, at least from the initial idea, was for users to create their own reading lists, appending in literature as they see fit; mainly web-based literature that has links, though it isn't a requirement to use the bot.

Additionally, of course, there's updating a user's reading list to show said literature as complete, marking pages with a bookmark, highlighting pages, and reviewing the literature; at least for initial ideas, there's a high possibility that more will come.

Moving to a server-based perspective, the bot also allows for users to "donate" their literature to a kind of public bookshelf, which is more or less like a server-wide reading list that anyone on said server can access and read from, as well as add to their own reading list; at least for now, of course.

### What may be?

It may be foreseeable some time in the future to have a global bookshelf, too; though as of right now that's just a thought, if nothing else.
Somewhat in the same breath, is the possibility that the general file structure moves over into some form of database, with possible contenders such as mongoDB, SQL, Postgres, etc.

### What now?
Pretty much all development as of right now is just running small tests to figure out the general idea of file creation, reading, appending, and parsing.
Getting the basics of getting reading lists, bookmarks, page highlights, book reviews, and bookshelves to work properly is key.
